## 🏠 PRO-REALTY: Real Estate Price Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts real estate prices based on property features. This model helps estimate the value of properties for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Data cleaning and preprocessing for housing data.
  
- Feature engineering to enhance model accuracy.
  
- Visualization of key variables affecting real estate prices.
  
- Machine learning model development for price prediction.
  
- Evaluation of regression model performance

## 🔧 Technologies & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🏗️ Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values and outliers
   - Converted categorical features to numeric

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Price distributions and location-based analysis

3. **Model Development**
   - Train-test split
   - Model training using regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression)
   - Hyperparameter tuning 

4. **Evaluation**
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R² score

## 📊 Sample Visuals

- Price distribution by location
- Correlation matrix of features
- Predicted vs actual price comparison plots
